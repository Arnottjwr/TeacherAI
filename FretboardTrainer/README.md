# Note Recogniser 
Based on Brandon D'Eon's excercise for memorising the notes of the fretboard (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PMZWb6ZNJc&t=180s&pp=ygUjYnJhbmRvbiBkZW9uIG5vdGVzIG9mIHRoZSBmcmV0Ym9hcmQ%3D)), this script will test your memorisation of the note of each string. The program will display a note, which the user must play within a certain time frame. The program will then evaluate whether the right note was played. If correct, the next note will be displayed, otherwise, the player can try again. If *hard mode* is enabled, the player will have to begin from the start if they make a mistake.
